# homelab

Welcome to my cybersecurity home lab: a segmented, enterprise-style environment where I design, build, and break down infrastructure to better understand how security works at scale.

This project represents my personal exploration across all areas of modern IT and security:

- Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, VLANs, Windows Event Collection
- SIEM integration with Wazuh and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Threat detection, incident response, and log pipeline tuning
- Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) and Zero Trust
- Cloud security architecture and secure infrastructure deployments
- Application and API security including OWASP Top 10 and real-world exploit testing
- Compliance, hardening, and hands-on implementation of security frameworks

While some integrations related to work are excluded, everything here reflects my hands-on approach and passion for understanding security at a deep level.

> ğŸ’¡ I built this lab not just to study, but because I genuinely love this stuff. The learning never stops.
